# Lordran Ipsum
This app generates randomized lorem ipsum made up of Dark Souls NPC dialogue. It utilizes a Durstenfeld Shuffle to efficiently create a list of random integers with which we index an array of dialogue strings. 

The dialogue was scraped from the Dark Souls WikiDot via Python, Requests, and BS4. [Check out the web scraper repo here](https://github.com/blangwell/souls-wiki-scrape).

Font used is [Dico](https://www.dafont.com/dico.font) by Yannic KÃ¶tter.
